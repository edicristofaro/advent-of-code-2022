This seemed like a great opportunity to write a little bit of code every day for a month, especially since I didn't finish last year! A lot of this code isn't pretty. In fact, it's possible that none of it is.

To whatever extent these help you to solve the problems yourself, great! Or if you want to look and know that you write better code than at least one other person out there, also great!

I will say that if you're stuck and have the urge to peek at a solution, don't unless you're really stuck - more than a day stuck. You can solve it yourself, and you'll feel good that you did it.
